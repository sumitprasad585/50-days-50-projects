                <h1>Cliff Jumping</h1>
                <h2>Sometimes All you need is a few seconds of insane courage</h2>
                <p>Cliff jumping is jumping off a cliff as a form of sport. When done without equipment, it may be also
                    known as
                    tombstoning. It forms part of the sport of coastal exploration or "coasteering". When performed with
                    a parachute,
                    it is known as BASE jumping. The world record for cliff jumping is currently held by Laso Schaller,
                    with a jump of
                    58.8 m</p>

                <p>Cliff diving is probably the least complicated extreme sport. There's no equipment to buy, no special
                    clothing to wear
                    and no provider services to hire. It's just your body, sailing through the air from dizzying heights
                    and plunging into a
                    body of water below. Think of jumping off an eight-story building. That's the height -- 85 feet (26
                    meters) -- from
                    which the 2009 Cliff Diving World Championship competitors dove.

                    Competition cliff diving is an outgrowth of Olympic high diving. But the daredevil act dates back to
                    1770, when King
                    Kahekili, the last king of Maui, leapt from Kaunolu, a 63-foot (19-meter) cliff and entered the
                    water below without
                    causing a splash. For his regular feats of flying from the cliffs, the king earned the nickname
                    "birdman." Later, he
                    made his warriors jump from cliffs to prove their courage and loyalty.</p>
